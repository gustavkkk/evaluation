This project is modified from https://gist.github.com/kekeblom/204a609ee295c81c3cc202ecbe68752c.
selenium and a proxy (whose port is 1080) is needed.
This project is currently used for downloading image from google image without using google api.
Sometimes, the final searching number is small, eg. count=500, but only return 28. This may be related to the webdriver, it's a bug, but I don't know how to fix it. Run it again, it returns correctly.
Add soso support.
